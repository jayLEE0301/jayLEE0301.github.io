**Abstract:** Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging control tasks for various robot environments. In this paper, we study a goal reaching task for a 2D robot in changing environments through distributional RL and a graph search algorithm. We apply a Search on the Replay Buffer (SoRB) algorithm which combines the strength of RL and path planning to maintain a relatively small number of nodes and reach a goal with a policy network. To evaluate our method, we test the trained model and the graph search algorithm in environments where an obstacle interrupts the planned path of the agent. Our algorithm enables agents to find an appropriate path in changing environments and successfully follow the path to reach a goal.
