<p> In Spring 2021, I joined <a href="http://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (former ICSL) in Seoul National University to pursue research in <b>Robotics</b>..</p>
<p> My research interests in robotics are <b>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</b>, <b>Meta Reinforcement Learning</b> and <b>Image-Based Reinforcement Learning</b> </p>
